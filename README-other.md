_A Forge 1.12.2 only modpack with pure optimizations and nothing else._

A Forge/~~Cleanroom~~ ([Cleanroom](discord.gg/f2K4aSpG4F) support is planned) modpack
that uses the latest optimization mods for Minecraft 1.12.2 while adding no other gameplay,
QoL, etc. features.

Intended to use in new singleplayer playthroughs as a standalone,
but I will eventually release server-only instances and instructions for integration in existing modpacks.

(there is not enough testing,
but please try it
and [open an issue in the tracker](https://github.com/Levviata/Levviatas-Optimization-Pack/issues)
if you have any problem.)

(the modpack name on the web (modrinth, CurseForge, and GitHub) is "Levviata's Optimization Pack" for visibility,
the pack is named "Optimum" internally)
