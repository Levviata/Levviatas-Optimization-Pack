# Levviata's Optimization Pack
A Forge/~~Cleanroom~~ ([Cleanroom](https://discord.com/invite/f2K4aSpG4F) support is planned) modpack
that uses the latest optimization mods for Minecraft 1.12.2 while adding no other gameplay,
QoL, etc. features.

Intended to use in new singleplayer playthroughs as a standalone,
but I will eventually release server and instructions for integration in existing modpacks.

(there is not enough testing,
but please try it
and [open an issue in the tracker](https://github.com/Levviata/Levviatas-Optimization-Pack/issues)
if you have any problem.)

(the modpack name on the web (Modrinth, CurseForge, and GitHub) is "Levviata's Optimization Pack" for visibility,
the pack is named "Optimum" internally)

## Download
Choose CurseForge for your preferred website to download as it is the easiest to use:

**CurseForge:** 
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/levviatas-optimization-pack

**Modrinth:**
- https://modrinth.com/modpack/levviatas-optimization-pack

Uploaded versions on CurseForge and Modrinth have no differences. You don't have to care about it.

<details>
  <summary><h3>But if you do care, here's an explanation</h3></summary>
  
----
The only difference that "matters"
is that the modpack version on Modrinth uses [File Director](https://modrinth.com/mod/filedirector) to download these mods:

- [Entity Culling](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entity-culling)
- [Nothirium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nothirium)
- [RenderLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/renderlib)
- [Multithreaded Noise](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/multithreaded-noise)

There is currently no other way to bundle those mods with the [Modrinth] modpack.

This is because of:

- Mods might not be on CurseForge or Modrinth or vice versa.
- Distribution permissions are different from CurseForge to Modrinth and vice versa.
- Some mods have restrictive licenses which do not allow distribution.

## Performance Comparison
TODO: add images for comparison (against vanilla, etc.)
also check how Entity Cull (current) differs from the other Entity Cull (by tr7zw)
