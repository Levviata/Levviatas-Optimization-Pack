## Optifine

No, thanks. Why not? See below.

[death"](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/12qpidr/is_optifine_that_bad/) -> _NOTE:
Kindly taken from [Opti Not So Fine](https://github.com/Radk6/MC-Optimization-Guide/blob/85fe6cf2c438b2c2ecc6c9cd103d064db3a06186/mods-n-stuff/opti-not-so-fine.md) by [Radk6](https://github.com/Radk6)_

Small, digestible, list here:

- It does not mix well with mods that try to do the same ([Nothirium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nothirium), [Vintagium](https://github.com/Asek3/sodium-1.12), etc.)
- It tends to increase loading times, especially in bigger modpacks
- Some of its features can break other mods (for example, Fast Math or Smooth World options)
- Most likely lags behind performance compared to other optimization mods (which are also actively maintained in comparison)
- Not nice to work with due to restrictive license, and developers already have to be careful enough with Minecraft's own license. _Don't add another rooster to a chicken pen, one is enough._

TLDRÂ²:
Optifine is a good general purpose optimization mod,
but for our application, it's not enough and actually makes optimization lag behind (literally).

<sub>TODO: Make a full and comprehensive list of alternatives to Optifine's Quality of Life [QoL]
(as telling people to ditch all of it in favor of only a better render engine is stupid.)</sub>

## Optimization mod Incompatibility 101

[Nothirium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nothirium) and [Vintagium](https://github.com/Asek3/sodium-1.12) rework the rendering system heavily,
making some mod's rendering to straight out not work.

([Nothirium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nothirium) has been reported to have better mod support than [Vintagium](https://github.com/Asek3/sodium-1.12) in the [Cleanroom Discord](https://discord.com/invite/f2K4aSpG4F) server,
but that is my personal insight.)

Some of the current incompatibilities:

_NOTE: This list might be out of date as it was made on 1/24/2025!
This list also doesn't include all the incompatibilities neither might it be 100% correct,
take this information with a grain of salt.

## Other Misc Incompatibilities

### [NoiseThreader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/noisethreader)

Replaced by its "better"
uncle [Multithreaded Noise,](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/multithreaded-noise)
which also does not add another (possibly) redundant dependency.

about integrating this modpack's optimizations into your already existing modpack,
please see [Modpack Specific Optimizations](https://github.com/Radk6/MC-Optimization-Guide/blob/main/modpack-specific/modpack-instructions.md) by [Radk6](https://github.com/Radk6),
it is not a directly useful guide, but it will help you a ton.
